# eros not enough
> eros development there are many restrictions, developers need to consider.

* -Although weex supports compiling three-terminal, ** eros does not currently support browser-side ** and currently only focuses on native.
* eros can not automatically use weex market temporarily, but if you have native development experience you can access.
* Because eros uses the appboard mechanism with the ** JS Bundle ** run-time mechanism to reduce the size of the js bundle, weex debug requires special processing.
*  If you encounter complex pages, such as IM, eros recommended native implementation, weex to cope with such needs is still relatively difficult.

The Benmu's medical technical team itself has also developed three weex based app, can be downloaded in the Apple store and application treasure:
* Health Capital (Beijing Medical pass app version, 100 + page, many features have not yet opened)
* Benmu Medical Assistant (30+ pages)
* enmu Doctor Assistant (20+ pages)
